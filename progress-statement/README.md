# Configuration

Write a config.ini file so that the program knows where your OrderClerk trades are being stored, and
where to throw the output - something like this:

```ini
[paths]
input_dir=C:\Users\johnc\OneDrive - Effective Flow\Trading\RT\Env_LiveTrading\OrderClerk
output_dir=C:\Users\johnc\OneDrive - Effective Flow\Trading\RT\Env_LiveTrading
```
